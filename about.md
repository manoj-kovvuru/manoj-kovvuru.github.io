# About

![photo](/images/photo.png)I am a researcher who worked at [CSIR](https://www.csir.res.in/) for 2 years. I completed my Master's degree in Mechatronics at School of Mechatronics & Robotics in [Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology](https://www.iiests.ac.in/). I am passionate about science and it's implementation. I spend most of time in Mathematics and coding.

I am a self taught programmer. Thanks to [Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/andrewng) and [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown) who ignited me to learn Machine Learning. I am a fan of [Franchois Chollet](https://twitter.com/fchollet),  [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/) and [Jeremy Howard](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward) in Deep Learning. 

I learnt Machine Learning and programming mostly through blogs and Youtube. I firmly believe in giving back to the community and in that attempt I started this blog. Thanks to Jermy Howard through [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) who gave me the initial push. 

The focus of this blog is to introduce you to some of my projects, explaining things and implementation in code and my opinions and understanding of recent trends in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. 

If you feel that any of these ideas can be expressed in a better way, I am very happy to receive constructive feedback. Please feel free to reach out to me via [twitter](https://twitter.com/manoj_io)
